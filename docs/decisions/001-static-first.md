# 001 - Static-first architecture

## Decision

The site is implemented as a fully static site generated by Hugo.

## Context

The PRD requires:

- No runtime backend dependencies.
- Global CDN distribution.
- High stability and low maintenance cost.

## Consequences

- Pages are generated at build time and served from a CDN.
- Dynamic features (views, likes, comments) must be implemented via serverless or third-party services in later versions.*** End Patch"""
